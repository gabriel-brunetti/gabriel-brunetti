### Gabriel Brunetti - @gabriel-brunetti ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Gabriel - a full stack web developer, with a front-end focus. I've previously worked as a teacher at Digital House Brazil, where I've helped dozens of people enter and discover the joys of the coding universe, like I've did on the same school.
Due to my architecture background, I naturally bring another look into development, where design thinking, usability and aesthetics aspects are part of the coding process since it's concepction.
I'm alwyas into learning something new, EUIV + FIFA player, and a home studio producer.
